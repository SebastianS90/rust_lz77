LZ77 in Rust
============

This is a short implementation of [LZ77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78#LZ77) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
The algorithm was stolen and adopted from [the Whiley Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/Whiley/WyBench/blob/master/src/009_lz77/Main.whiley).

Import it as an eclipse project, using the [RustDT plugin](https://github.com/RustDT/RustDT).
